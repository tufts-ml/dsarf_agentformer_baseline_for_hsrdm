# DSARF on Figure 8, Agentformer on Basketball
Baselines on Figure 8 and Basketball data for paper titled 'Discovering group dynamics in synchronous time series via hierarchical recurrent switching-state models'


## DSARF on Figure 8
For reproducing the experiments for complete independence, multi channel and complete pooling, see the notebook provided in [dsarf_on_figure_8/DSARF_on_figure_8.ipynb](dsarf_on_figure_8/DSARF_on_figure_8.ipynb)

## AgentFormer on Basketball
For reproducing the experiments for predicting basketball player trajectories, follow the readme in [agentformer_on_bball/](agentformer_on_bball/)
